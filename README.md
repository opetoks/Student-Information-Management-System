# Student-Information-Management-System
This application manages students information and course registartion process.

The applicaion is originaly prepared in php, but i am making the public copy of it here in python. I assume you have python installed on your system python 2 or 3 as the time of writing.

I am running python2 but ubuntu 16.04 has python 3 by default.
so i will be using pip2 in all my installation commands

Running this application require the installation of virtual environment, and we will be using Flask libraries. on my ubuntu system this is how i go about it.
From the terminal using ctrl T, navigate into the folder containing this project run the following command from the terminal
      
      ...   $ virtuelenv venv

This create a folder 'venv'

using source command, do this: $ source venv/bin/activate

this command makes your terminal become (venv)$ 

indicating the virtual environment is active

$ pip2 install flask
