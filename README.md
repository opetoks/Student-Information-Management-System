# Student-Information-Management-System
This application manages students information and course registartion process
The applicaion is originaly prepared in php, but i am making the public copy of it here in python.
Running this application require the installation of virtual environment, on my ubuntu system this is how i go about it.
From the terminal using ctrl T, navigate into the folder containing this project run the following command from the terminal
       ...   $ virtuelenv venv
This create a folder 'venv'
using source command, do this: $ source venv/bin/activate
this command makes your terminal become (venv)$ 
indicating the virtual environment is active
